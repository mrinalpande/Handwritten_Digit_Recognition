# Using neural nets to recognize handwritten digits

Handwriting is the most basic form of human expression. Humans have created many
different writing system, but digits are the most basic writing system understood by
everyone. This project aims at learning and implementing of a basic artificial intelligence
that will learn to recognize handwritten digits. Handwriting recognition is one of those
problems that will help to understand the basic concepts and create a foundation for
neural networks. Using the standard MNSIT dataset of handwritten digits and
develop a system which will learn from those training examples. This dataset is a 
standard dataset for handwriting recognition.
